# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Pewlett Hackard has many employees who will potentially be retiring soon. They will be offering a retirement package for those who meet a certain criteria. They are also
starting to think about which positions will need to be filled in the near future. Our co-worker Bobby has been tasked with finding out: 1) who will be retiring in the next few years, and 2) how many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill?

We helped Bobby build an SQL database, using 6 CSV files provided by Pewlett Hackard Human Resources. From this database we were able to garner a lot of great info, including the number of retiring employees per title, and employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.


## Results
Below is the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) we created. This diagram gives a great visualization for the 6 CSVs we were provided, and how they relate/connect with one another.

## Summary

In summary, Pewlett Hackard definitely needs to start planning for the future. Many positions will need to be filled, but there are many qualified employees that can help transition the company into their next phase. We highly recommend that the company develops a mentorship program. Not only will this benefit the company, the employees leaving will gain a sense of closure, and the employees staying on with the company will have adequate training to take on their new roles.
